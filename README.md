# System Design

> *This is a work in progress, and will be updated as I go along.*

This will be a set of articles around how systems work, and good practices to follow while designing systems. Many of the articles are in part or in full generated by AI. The intent is not to invent something, but rather to collect and organize information in a way that is easy to understand and follow.
