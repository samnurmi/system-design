## Understanding the Current Working Directory (CWD) in Ubuntu

### 1. User Space vs. Kernel Space

Linux systems distinguish between:

- **Kernel Space**: Where the Linux kernel operates. It directly manages hardware devices, memory, and process scheduling.
- **User Space**: Where user-level applications run. They communicate with the kernel through system calls.

### 2. Shell and CWD

In Ubuntu, opening a terminal means interacting with a **shell** (often `bash`). The shell is the user's interface to the system.

- When you execute `pwd` in the terminal, it retrieves the CWD from an internal variable in the shell. Changing directories with `cd` updates this variable.

### 3. Kernelâ€™s Role

The kernel facilitates operations related to file and directory management.

- System calls like `chdir` and `getcwd` enable changing the directory and fetching the current directory path.
  
### 4. Filesystem and inode

Each file and directory in Linux corresponds to an `inode`, which houses metadata. Directories map names to these inodes, and the kernel references inodes when navigating directories.

### 5. The `/proc` Filesystem

The `/proc` virtual filesystem offers information about processes. For instance, the CWD of a process with PID `1234` can be viewed via:

```bash
ls -l /proc/1234/cwd
```

### 6. CWD in User-Level Programs

Programs such as text editors or compilers will often default to the CWD, especially if no absolute path is designated.

### 7. Security Considerations

Ensuring a secure CWD is vital, as potential attackers might exploit relative paths to run harmful scripts or binaries.

Certainly! The internal or "hidden" processes usually aren't executed via terminal commands in the way users interact with a shell, but they can be thought of as operations or function calls that the kernel, filesystem, or other system components perform. Let's delve into these:

### Scenarios: Interactions with the CWD

#### 1. Creation of a Directory

```plantuml
@startuml
title Creation of a Directory

start
:(1) User sends request to create directory \n`mkdir new_directory`;
:(2) System resolves path where directory should be created \n`resolve_path(new_directory)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `kernel_path_lookup(target_directory)`
:(3) Check user permissions for creating directory at path \n`check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_directory, WRITE)`
if (Has permission?) then (yes)
  :(4) Create directory at resolved path \n`create_dir(resolved_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_mkdir(target_directory)`
  :(5) Return success to user \n`echo "Directory created successfully"`;
else (no)
  :(6) Return permission denied error to user \n`echo "Permission denied"`;
endif
stop

@enduml
```

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: `mkdir new_directory` command in the terminal indicates user intent.
- **(2)**: System function `resolve_path(new_directory)` determines the directory's creation path.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_path_lookup(target_directory)` - The kernel confirms the validity and location of the directory path.
- **(3)**: The system checks user permissions via `check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_directory, WRITE)` - The filesystem inspects the access control list for user write permissions on the target directory.
- **(4)**: After confirming permissions, the directory is formed using `create_dir(resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_mkdir(target_directory)` - The kernel performs the directory creation operation.
- **(5)**: User receives a success message.
- **(6)**: If permissions are denied, an error message is displayed.

#### 2. Creation of a File

```plantuml
@startuml
title Creation of a File

start
:(1) User sends request to create file \n`touch new_file.txt`;
:(2) System resolves path where file should be created \n`resolve_path(new_file.txt)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `kernel_path_lookup(target_file)`
:(3) Check user permissions for creating file at path \n`check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_file, WRITE)`
if (Has permission?) then (yes)
  :(4) Create file at resolved path \n`create_file(resolved_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_create(target_file)`
  :(5) Return success to user \n`echo "File created successfully"`;
else (no)
  :(6) Return permission denied error to user \n`echo "Permission denied"`;
endif
stop

@enduml
```

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: User initiates file creation with `touch new_file.txt`.
- **(2)**: The path for file creation is ascertained using `resolve_path(new_file.txt)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_path_lookup(target_file)` - The kernel confirms the validity and location of the file path.
- **(3)**: User permissions are verified through `check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_file, WRITE)` - The filesystem checks the access control list for user write permissions on the target file.
- **(4)**: Post permission validation, the file is generated using `create_file(resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_create(target_file)` - The kernel performs the file creation operation.
- **(5)**: A success message is relayed to the user.
- **(6)**: In case of denied permissions, an error is displayed.

#### 3. Code differentiating between Absolute and Relative Path

```plantuml
@startuml
title Absolute vs Relative Path

start
:(1) User provides a path for operation \n`cd provided_path`;
if (Path starts with root or drive letter?) then (Absolute)
  :(2) Use the path directly for operation \n`operate_on(provided_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_abs_path_resolution(provided_path)`
else (Relative)
  :(3) Combine CWD with the relative path \n`path = combine_path(CWD, provided_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_rel_path_resolution(CWD, provided_path)`
  :(4) Use the combined path for operation \n`operate_on(path)`;
endif
:(5) Execute operation on the resolved path;
:(6) Return operation results to user \n`echo "Operation completed"`;
stop

@enduml
```

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: A user might provide a path for operations such as `cd provided_path`.
- **(2)**: For absolute paths (those starting with a root like / or a drive letter in other OS), the system will use the path directly.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_abs_path_resolution(provided_path)` - The kernel identifies and resolves absolute paths.
- **(3)**: If it's a relative path, it's combined with the CWD to form the full path.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_rel_path_resolution(CWD, provided_path)` - The kernel combines the current working directory with the relative path to determine the full path.
- **(4)**: The combined path is then used for the operation.
- **(5)**: The system executes the operation on the resolved path.
- **(6)**: Upon completion, the user receives feedback on the operation's results.

### Commands, Software, and Libraries Used:

- **Creation of a Directory**
  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory
  ```
  - Software/Library: `bash` shell (commonly used in Ubuntu).
  
- **Creation of a File**
  ```bash
  touch new_file.txt
  ```
  - Software/Library: `bash` shell.

- **Visualization of the scenarios**

Note: The "hidden operations" described are abstractions and simplifications of what might occur at a lower level in the system, particularly within the kernel or filesystem. They represent conceptual actions rather than literal function names or commands.
