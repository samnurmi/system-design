## Understanding the Current Working Directory (CWD) in Ubuntu

### 1. User Space vs. Kernel Space

Linux systems distinguish between:

- **Kernel Space**: Where the Linux kernel operates. It directly manages hardware devices, memory, and process scheduling.
- **User Space**: Where user-level applications run. They communicate with the kernel through system calls.

### 2. Shell and CWD

In Ubuntu, opening a terminal means interacting with a **shell** (often `bash`). The shell is the user's interface to the system.

- When you execute `pwd` in the terminal, it retrieves the CWD from an internal variable in the shell. Changing directories with `cd` updates this variable.

### 3. Kernelâ€™s Role

The kernel facilitates operations related to file and directory management.

- System calls like `chdir` and `getcwd` enable changing the directory and fetching the current directory path.
  
### 4. Filesystem and inode

Each file and directory in Linux corresponds to an `inode`, which houses metadata. Directories map names to these inodes, and the kernel references inodes when navigating directories.

### 5. The `/proc` Filesystem

The `/proc` virtual filesystem offers information about processes. For instance, the CWD of a process with PID `1234` can be viewed via:

```bash
ls -l /proc/1234/cwd
```

### 6. CWD in User-Level Programs

Programs such as text editors or compilers will often default to the CWD, especially if no absolute path is designated.

### 7. Security Considerations

Ensuring a secure CWD is vital, as potential attackers might exploit relative paths to run harmful scripts or binaries.

### Scenarios: Interactions with the CWD

#### 1. Creation of a Directory

```plantuml
@startuml
title Creation of a Directory

start
:(1) User sends request to create directory \n`mkdir new_directory`;
:(2) System resolves path where directory should be created \n`resolve_path(new_directory)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `kernel_path_lookup(target_directory)`
:(3) Check user permissions for creating directory at path \n`check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_directory, WRITE)`
if (Has permission?) then (yes)
  :(4) Create directory at resolved path \n`create_dir(resolved_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_mkdir(target_directory)`
  :(5) Return success to user \n`echo "Directory created successfully"`;
else (no)
  :(6) Return permission denied error to user \n`echo "Permission denied"`;
endif
stop

U -> SH : (1) mkdir new_directory
activate SH

SH -> S : (1) mkdir() for new_directory
activate S

S -> S : (2) resolve_path(new_directory)
note right: If relative, combines with CWD for full path

S -> K : (2) kernel_path_lookup(target_directory)

activate FS
note right: Hidden Operation: filesystem_check_acl(user, target_directory, WRITE)

FS -> S : Permission status

### Scenarios: Interactions with the CWD

#### 1. Creation of a Directory

**Command**:
```bash
mkdir new_directory
```

**Steps**:

##### 1.1. User sends request to create directory
- The shell interprets the `mkdir` command.
- A system call, `mkdir()`, is invoked by the shell.
  
**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: `mkdir new_directory` command in the terminal indicates user intent. This operation is dependent on the CWD if an absolute path is not specified.
  
##### 1.2. System resolves path where directory should be created
- The kernel performs a path lookup using functions such as `lookup_one_len()`.
- If a relative path is given, the kernel combines the CWD with the provided directory name to resolve the full path.
- Function: `resolve_path(new_directory)`

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: `mkdir new_directory` command in the terminal indicates user intent.
- **(2)**: System function `resolve_path(new_directory)` determines the directory's creation path using the CWD as a base for relative paths.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_path_lookup(target_directory)` - The kernel confirms the validity and location of the directory path using the CWD.
- **(3)**: The system checks user permissions via `check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_directory, WRITE)` - The filesystem inspects the access control list for user write permissions on the target directory.
- **(4)**: After confirming permissions, the directory is formed using `create_dir(resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_mkdir(target_directory)` - The kernel performs the directory creation operation using the information derived from the CWD.
- **(5)**: User receives a success message.
- **(6)**: If permissions are denied, an error message is displayed.

#### 2. Creation of a File

```plantuml
@startuml
title Creation of a File

start
:(1) User sends request to create file \n`touch new_file.txt`;
:(2) System resolves path where file should be created \n`resolve_path(new_file.txt)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `kernel_path_lookup(target_file)`
:(3) Check user permissions for creating file at path \n`check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`;
-- Hidden Operation: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_file, WRITE)`
if (Has permission?) then (yes)
  :(4) Create file at resolved path \n`create_file(resolved_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_create(target_file)`
  :(5) Return success to user \n`echo "File created successfully"`;
else (no)
  :(6) Return permission denied error to user \n`echo "Permission denied"`;
endif
stop

title Scenarios: Interactions with the CWD - Creation of a File

participant User as U
participant Shell as SH
participant System as S
participant FileSystem as FS
participant Kernel as K

U -> SH : (1) touch new_file.txt
activate SH

SH -> S : (1) open() with create flags for new_file.txt
activate S

note right: If relative, combines with CWD for full path

S -> K : (2) kernel_path_lookup(target_file)
activate K
K -> S : Resolved path
deactivate K
note right: Hidden Operation to validate and pinpoint file path

S -> FS : (3) check_permissions(user, resolved_path)
activate FS
note right: Hidden Operation: filesystem_check_acl(user, target_file, WRITE)

FS -> S : Permission status
deactivate FS

alt Has permission?
    S -> FS : (4) create_file(resolved_path)
    activate FS
    note right: Hidden Operation: kernel_create(target_file)
    FS -> S : File creation successful
    deactivate FS
    S -> SH : File created
    SH -> U : (5) echo "File created successfully"
else
    S -> SH : Permission denied
    SH -> U : (6) echo "Permission denied"

### Scenarios: Interactions with the CWD

#### 2. Creation of a File

**Command**:
```bash
touch new_file.txt
```

**Steps**:

##### 2.1. User sends request to create file
- The shell interprets the `touch` command.
- A system call related to file creation, e.g., `open()`, is invoked by the shell with specific flags to create the file if it doesn't exist.
  
**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: User initiates file creation with `touch new_file.txt`. This operation often relies on the CWD if an absolute path isn't provided.
  
##### 2.2. System establishes the path for file creation
- If a relative path is indicated, the system combines the CWD with the provided file name to determine the full path.
- Function: `resolve_path(new_file.txt)`

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: User initiates file creation with `touch new_file.txt`.
- **(2)**: The path for file creation is ascertained using `resolve_path(new_file.txt)`. If a relative path is given, the system uses the CWD as a base to determine the full path.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_path_lookup(target_file)` - The kernel validates and pinpoints the file path, taking into account the CWD for relative paths.
- **(3)**: User permissions are verified through `check_permissions(user, resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `filesystem_check_acl(user, target_file, WRITE)` - The filesystem verifies the access control list to determine user write permissions on the intended file.
- **(4)**: After the permissions are validated, the file is generated using `create_file(resolved_path)`.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_create(target_file)` - The kernel carries out the file creation operation using the details obtained from the CWD.
- **(5)**: A success message is communicated to the user.
- **(6)**: If permissions are denied, an error message is presented.

#### 3. Code differentiating between Absolute and Relative Path

```plantuml
@startuml
title Absolute vs Relative Path

start
:(1) User provides a path for operation \n`cd provided_path`;
if (Path starts with root or drive letter?) then (Absolute)
  :(2) Use the path directly for operation \n`operate_on(provided_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_abs_path_resolution(provided_path)`
else (Relative)
  :(3) Combine CWD with the relative path \n`path = combine_path(CWD, provided_path)`;
  -- Hidden Operation: `kernel_rel_path_resolution(CWD, provided_path)`
  :(4) Use the combined path for operation \n`operate_on(path)`;
endif
:(5) Execute operation on the resolved path;
:(6) Return operation results to user \n`echo "Operation completed"`;
stop

@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User as U
participant Shell as S
participant FileSystem as FS
participant Kernel as K

U -> S : (1) cd provided_path
activate S

S -> S : Determine path type
alt Absolute Path
    S -> FS : (2) Use provided_path directly
    activate FS
    FS -> K : Hidden: kernel_abs_path_resolution(provided_path)
    activate K
    K --> FS : Resolved absolute path
    deactivate K
    FS --> S : Path verification complete
    deactivate FS
else Relative Path
    S -> FS : Retrieve CWD
    activate FS
    FS --> S : Return CWD
    S -> K : (3) kernel_rel_path_resolution(CWD, provided_path)
    activate K
    K --> S : Combined path
    deactivate K
end

S -> FS : (4) Perform cd operation
activate FS
FS -> K : Change directory to resolved path
activate K
K --> FS : Operation status
deactivate K
FS --> S : Operation feedback
deactivate FS

S -> U : (5) Display feedback to user
deactivate S

U -> U : (6) Receive feedback on operation's results

### Scenarios: Changing Directories using the CWD

#### 3. Navigating Directories

**Command**:
```bash
cd provided_path
```

**Steps**:

##### 3.1. User expresses intention to change directory
- The shell processes the `cd` command.
- Depending on the path's nature (absolute or relative), the system will take different actions to resolve it.
  
**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: A user expresses their intent to change the directory, often relying on the CWD if they haven't provided an absolute path. The command in action: `cd provided_path`.

##### 3.2. System determines the nature of the provided path
- If the path begins with a root marker like '/', it's treated as an absolute path.
- Conversely, without such markers, the path is treated as relative, and the system will refer to the CWD to decipher the full directory path.

**Explanations**:
- **(1)**: A user provides a path for operations like `cd provided_path`.
- **(2)**: For absolute paths (those starting with root markers such as '/'), the system utilizes the path as it is.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_abs_path_resolution(provided_path)` - The kernel processes and resolves the absolute paths directly without any need for the CWD.
- **(3)**: If a relative path is entered, it gets combined with the CWD to yield the complete path.
  - **Hidden Operation**: `kernel_rel_path_resolution(CWD, provided_path)` - Using the current working directory as a reference, the kernel fuses it with the relative path to establish the full directory path.
  
##### 3.3. Execution and Feedback
- Using the resolved path, the system enacts the directory change.
- After the operation's success or failure, the user is given an update.

**Explanations**:
- **(4)**: With the determined path (whether direct or combined with CWD), it becomes the basis for the directory change operation.
- **(5)**: The system activates the operation on the ascertained path.
- **(6)**: After finalizing the operation, feedback is rendered to the user, illuminating the outcome.
